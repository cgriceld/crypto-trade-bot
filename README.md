Trade robot on Kraken Futures [demo-platform](https://demo-futures.kraken.com/futures/PI_XBTUSD).

Project tech-features:
* Clean Architecture design pattern
* Graceful Shutdown
* go-chi, Gorilla WebSocket, Postgres (pgx), logrus
* Integration with Telegram Bot
* REST API and Websocket API on Kraken Futures (demo) support
* Unit-tests coverage

‚ùóÔ∏è Robot works with API of **demo** version of platform\
‚ùóÔ∏è Trading logic of the robot does not guarantee profitability

# robot

* The robot uses stop-loss/take-profit strategy. User can configure robot by setting market, price and size. After robot is successfully started, it listens on 1-minute candles (via websocket subscription), compares the average candle price with user settings and sends ioc order on Kraken if the price is triggered.
* The robot can be launched on several markets in parallel.

* For conditions of robot start see /start or /startall endpoint.
* Afer user configured inner robot order (/setsell or /setbuy) this order becomes active. If this order is trigged (sended to Kraken) or explicitly cancelled by the user (/unset...), it becomes inactive. 
* User can set a new order (e.g. set buy order if it was not set at startup), change the price and size in an already active one or cancel the order **when the robot is already running on market** (no need to stop the robot especially for that).

* The robot sends notifications to Telegram bot (see [notifications](#notifications)).
* Information about executed orders is stored in Postgres.

# setup

Parameters must be set as environmental variables (you can use `source setenv.sh` for convenience).

<pre>
APIPublic   - public API-key from Kraken demo-platform
API Private - private API-key from Kraken demo-platform
TgChatID    - Telegram bot chat ID
TgBotURL    - https://api.telegram.org/bot[token]/sendMessage
port        - port on which the robot server will run
dsn         - string for connecting to Postgres
</pre>

Use `docker-compose.yaml` to start Postgres.

Some `Makefile` rules:
* `make`      - start robot server
* `make test` - run tests with coverage
