# robot

* The robot uses stop-loss/take-profit strategy. User can configure robot by setting market, price and size. After robot is successfully started, it listens on 1-minute candles (via websocket subscription), compares the average candle price with user settings and sends ioc order on Kraken if the price is triggered.
* The robot can be launched on several markets in parallel.
* For conditions of robot start see /start or /startall endpoint.
* Afer user configured inner robot order (/setsell or /setbuy) this order becomes active. If this order is trigged (sended to Kraken) or explicitly cancelled by the user (/unset...), it becomes inactive. 
* User can set a new order (e.g. set buy order if it was not set at startup), change the price and size in an already active one or cancel the order **when the robot is already running on market** (no need to stop the robot especially for that).
* The robot sends notifications to Telegram bot (see [notifications](#notifications)).
* Information about executed orders is stored in Postgres.

# setup

Parameters must be set as environmental variables (you can use `source setenv.sh` for convenience).

* APIPublic   - public API-key from Kraken demo-platform
* API Private - private API-key from Kraken demo-platform
* TgChatID    - Telegram bot chat ID
* TgBotURL    - URL to the endpoint /SendMessage of Telegram containing the bot token
* port        - the port on which the robot server will run
* dsn         - string for connecting to Postgres

Use `docker-compose.yaml` to start Postgres.

Basic `Makefile` rules:
* `make`      - start robot server
* `make test` - run tests with coverage

# notifications

`‚úÖ Start subscription on market: pi_ethusd`

The robot is successfuly started on market.

---

`‚ö†Ô∏è Stop subscription on market: pi_ethusd`

The robot on market is stopped.

Reasons:
1. It was explicitly stopped by user (/stop, /stopall).
2. Websocket error (code 1006) and reconnection doesn't help.
3. Server is stopped (graceful shutdown).

---

`üìå Make buy order on pi_xbtusd. Price: 58620.50`

Order was successfuly placed and executed.

---

`‚ùå Fail to place order: pi_ethusd: sell: server error`

Fail to send order to Kraken due to inner error.

---

`‚ùå Fail to execute order: pi_xbtusd: sell: insufficient funds`

Order was rejected because of balance error.


---

`‚ùå Fail to execute order: pi_xbtusd: sell`

Order was rejected because of every another reason except balance error.
